# #100DaysofCode

I am trying to go through a structured 100 days of code challenge with a goal of spending 1:30 hours every day programming. 
This repo exists to document my progress and motivate me to paint the commit calendar green (commit logs - the original proof of work blockchain 😉).

Let's see on the other side. 🐣
