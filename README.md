# #100DaysofCode

I am trying to go through a structured 100 days of code challenge with a goal of spending 1:30 hours every day programming. 
This repo exists to document my progress and motivate me to paint the commit calendar green (commit logs - the original proof of work blockchain üòâ).

Let's see on the other side. üê£

So, I've decided to write my experiences here as I go through my journey. 
It has been hard to maintain a consistent schedule when you have a job that has no fixed boundaries on timing and social obligations that demand your presence. I have been on the Day 3 requirements for the past few days but managed to write a few lines of code. I am getting a hang of this (However basic it might be). I'll have to skip the lessons tomorrow and the next few days will be spent on catching up with work that I will miss tomorrow. Consistent effort is key, and any break in that consistency throws me off. I hope I'll catch with 7 days of lessons this week and proceed further in a pace that I am happy with.
